# Mental Health Analysis and Awareness

Welcome to our Mental Health Analysis repository! This project focuses on raising awareness about mental health, especially for individuals who may not be fully aware of the seriousness of their situation. We aim to build a model and eventually a working web application that groups people according to their mental states. The primary objective is to provide support and guidance through an automated chatbot or other means, tailored to individual needs.

## Why Mental Health Matters

Many individuals with depression may attempt to conceal their symptoms, and some may not even recognize that they are experiencing depression. While well-known signs like sadness and hopelessness are easily recognizable, there are also hidden signs that might go unnoticed.

## Project Highlights

- **Model Development**: We have developed a model using the PEBL framework and C++ to classify individuals based on their mental states.

- **General Mental Health Analysis**: Through extensive test batteries, we have conducted a general mental health analysis, achieving an accuracy rate of 89%.

## How It Works

Our model employs advanced techniques to classify individuals into different mental health categories. The insights gained from the analysis can be crucial in understanding the severity of the situation.

## Future Goals

The ultimate goal is to create a web application that not only classifies individuals but also provides tailored solutions. This could include an automated chatbot or other forms of guidance to support individuals in improving their mental well-being.

## Repository Contents
